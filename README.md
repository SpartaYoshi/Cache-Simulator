# cache-simulator
Optional project for Computer Architecture (2021). 

It's an 8-line cache memory simulator, written in Java, represented as a matrix in console. 

It only operates with memory addresses and determines access times, hit/miss rates and how it stores information within the cache. 
Memory data is not coded for operations, so it's not involved. 

Writing policy is Write-back.
Word, block and set sizes are configurable, as well as the replacement policies to use: FIFO or LRU.

Have fun testing! :3
